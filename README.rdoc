This is an attempt at a spinoff of the game series Touhou Project made by ZUN (or Team Alice Shanghai, whatever you wanna call him).  ZUN is a multi-talented guy.  He does all the artwork, all the music, and all the code for his games by himself.  I wanna be a multi-talented guy.  But I don't know much about drawing, I don't know anything about making music, and I only know a little about making 2D platformers in Java.  So this is a little project intended to help me work on my creative and coding skills.  

There is (so far) only gonna be one hero and one villain, no supporting characters.  Aisha is our hero, and Rachel is our villain.  The premise isn't super imaginative, but I wanna work on my drawing and music-making skills, and code too.  We all need a little imagination in our lives, right? ;)
